_If you need to **run** the project_ :
 
 1. As a production build
   * Open the html file in *'src/'* folder
 
 2. To look at the source code and debug
    * i) run the command **npm install** in the root directory (node.js required , this command is only to be run once, to install all the packages)
    * ii) then run the command **webpack** (this will bundle the files and replace files in *'src/'* directory)
    * iii) then run the command **npm run start** , this will make the project run on *localhost:3000* in browser. (you can check for logs in the browserâ€™s console)
