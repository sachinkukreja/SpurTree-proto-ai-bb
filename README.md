### Luis Application :
First things first , import the exported app (file ending with Shopping Bot) to LUIS and click train, then 

_To **run** the redux project_ :
 
 _As a production build_ :
  * Open the html file in *'src/'* folder
 
_To look at the *source code* and *debug*_ :

  * i) run the command **npm install** in the root directory (node.js required , this command is only to be run once, to install all the packages)
  * ii) then run the command **webpack** (this will bundle the files and replace files in *'src/'* directory)
  * iii) then run the command **npm run start** , this will make the project run on *localhost:3000* in browser. (you can check for logs in the browserâ€™s console)
